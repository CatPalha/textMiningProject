2. Lowercasing - Maren - done
3. Tokenization
  -Compounds (later) - Catarina research
  -Punctuation - after looking into it doesn't seem like a problem
4. Remove Stop-Words - Catarina - the stopwords module has portuguese as an option!! - done
5. Stemming and lemmatisation - Maren - attention: don't use both at the same time!!!!

with stemming

6. POS flitering (later)
