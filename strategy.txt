1. Normalization
  -Tokenize dates and numbers - probably not useful
  -Replace all accents - done
2. Lowercasing - done
3. Tokenization
  -Compounds (later) - we have n-grams but still not sure what to do about it
  -Punctuation - count it maybe? Remove it? - Catarina
4. Remove Stop-Words - check the accent problem - Mafalda
5. Stemming and lemmatisation - we're using lemmatization but we should see later if it performs better with stemming
6. POS flitering (later)
7. Bag-of-Words - Catarina

Careful with imbalanced learning
